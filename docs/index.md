OpenCerts, part of Singaporeâ€™s Smart Nation initiative, enables issuance and validation of tamper-resistant academic certificates in a convenient and reliable manner.

OpenCerts is built using [OpenAttestation](https://openattestation.com) standard and more particularly OpenCerts follows the Verifiable Document standard.

One might be confuse to understand the difference between OpenAttestation and OpenCerts:
- OpenAttestation is a standard that helps to create Verifiable Document.
- OpenCerts is a specific implementation, using OpenAttestation, whose purpose is to provide institutions a way to create Verifiable Certificates.

# Starting with OpenCerts

As OpenCerts is built using OpenAttestation standards, the best place to start playing with OpenCerts is to follow instructions about [starting with Verifiable Document on OpenAttestation documentation](https://openattestation.com/docs/verifiable-document/document-store).

> We strongly recommend people not familiar with OpenCerts to start by reading OpenAttestation documentation.

- [How to configure your identity through DNS-TXT.](https://openattestation.com/docs/verifiable-document/dns-proof)
- [How to develop and deploy templates for your certificates.](https://openattestation.com/docs/verifiable-document/document-template)
- [How to issue documents.](https://openattestation.com/docs/verifiable-document/issuing-document)

Please note that OpenCerts provides it's own portal to create document store and issue documents available at [https://admin.opencerts.io/](https://admin.opencerts.io/).

After reading the documentation, you can head up to the next part.
