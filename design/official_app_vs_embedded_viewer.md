# Official OpenCerts App vs SkillsFuture Passport embedded viewer

In either case the enabling feature is a frameless viewer hosted at https://opencerts.io/frameless_viewer, which has a text input where the cert to be rendered is filled into the input and rendering happens automatically.

Official OpenCerts App - a barebones standalone mobile app that the OS offers up when you try to open a .OpenCert file. All it does is display the frameless viewer with the opened cert file contents. If the user does not have the OpenCerts app then the file cannot be opened.

Skills Passport embedded viewer - an embedded viewer inside the SSG passport app that displays the certificates within without requiring switching to another application


|   | Embedded  | Official App  |
|---|---|---|
|__Pro__| - Smoother UX (view cert directly in skillspassport instead of having to install OpenCerts app) <br> - Offload any mobile app software demands onto SSG   | - In line with our messaging that OpenCerts is the only valid way to view a OpenCert <br> - Good for OpenCerts awareness and branding <br> - Viewer for non-educational certs <br> - Avenue for users to open .opencert files directly no matter how they received the file   |
|__Con__| - Dilution of OpenCerts messaging <br> - Increases centralisation and affiliation of OpenCerts with SSG (because they get to set the standards for all edu institutes in Singapore simply by making something a "requirement") -> it becomes a global OpenCerts standard  |  - High potential for scope creep <br> - manpower requirements <br> - Poor UX as the user is left without further instruction if he does not have OpenCert app installed |
