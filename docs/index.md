OpenCerts, part of Singaporeâ€™s Smart Nation initiative, enables issuance and validation of tamper-resistant academic certificates in a convenient and reliable manner.

OpenCerts is built on top of [OpenAttestation](https://openattestation.com). One might be confused to understand the differences between OpenAttestation and OpenCerts:
- OpenAttestation is a standard that helps to create Verifiable Document.
- OpenCerts is a specific implementation, using OpenAttestation, whose purpose is to provide institutions a way to create Verifiable Certificates.

# Starting with OpenCerts

As OpenCerts is built using OpenAttestation, the best place to start playing with OpenCerts is to follow instructions about [starting with Verifiable Document on OpenAttestation documentation](https://openattestation.com/docs/verifiable-document/overview).

> We strongly recommend people not familiar with OpenCerts to start by reading OpenAttestation documentation.
