# Pull Request Preview

Our automated pipeline builds a preview for every pull request that is submitted to this repository - you may use this for previewing your changes and doing User Testing before committing your changes. The preview will look exactly the same as it would if committed to master directly, so there is no difference in behaviour except for the URL.

Of the two `netlify` links, `production` uses the main Ethereum net for verifying the issuances and `development` uses the Ropsten test net.

### How to access the preview
