[The Admin Website Portal](https://admin.opencerts.io/) allows users to deploy document store and issue/revoke certificates with their Metamask Wallet or their Ledger Nano Device.

### Ledger Nano Device

[As Metamask supports Ledger Hardware Wallets](https://medium.com/@brunobar79), it is now recommended for users to connect using the Metamask flow.

Metamask can act as a proxy to interact with the Ledger Nano Device, simply use "Add Hardware Wallet" inside Metamask to add your Ledger Nano.
